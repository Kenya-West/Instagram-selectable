# Instagram-selectable

## Description

Instagram recently blocked users from selecting text on PCs. That's unfair!
With this style, you can select and copy any text in the description of a post.

## How to contribute

clone the repo, then:

1. `cd Instagram-selectable`

2. `npm install`

3. Make some changes in .scss files, for example, change colors in `.\src\colors.scss`

4. Install **[Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases)** add-on to your browser.

5. `npm run compile` to compile to `.\dist\style.css`

6. Paste the `style.css` file contents to **Stylus** -> *new style* and limit scope to domains described in the beginning of pasted code.
